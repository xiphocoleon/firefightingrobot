# Fire fighting robot group progress file

Updates:
Here is the current, cleanest version of the navigational code. I am working on the orientation and determineTurn functions. Please let me know if you'd like to help write these functions. Also, there is a modular sensor function that needs to be written. Please let me know if you'd like to write this. Instructions for this function are at the very end of the code.



Old:
I am moving our working code to another file. This file should just be our ReadMe file, which can track our progress. Each person here can write their name and the date they update something.
